# SQL Analytics Practice

This repository contains my practice in solving interview-style
data analytics problems using SQL, with a focus on reusable patterns
rather than one-off solutions.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Translate business questions into clear SQL logic
- Identify and document reusable SQL patterns
- Write clean, readable, and interview-ready queries

Problems are inspired by common analytics interview scenarios
(e.g., aggregation, ranking, window functions, date analysis)
and are written in a generalized format.

## Repository Structure

patterns/
- Reusable SQL patterns (templates + explanations)

## How I Use This Repo

When practicing SQL problems:
- If a reusable pattern is identified, it is added to `patterns/`
- If the problem is one-off, it is solved and not saved
- Previously documented patterns are reused and adapted when applicable

This approach keeps the repository concise and focused on long-term value.

## Tools
- SQL (PostgreSQL-style syntax)
